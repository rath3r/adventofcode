# Advent of Code 2023

How many days can I get through this year?

## Info

I'm running this using `ts-node` like so:

```
 npx ts-node src/day1/index.ts
```

## Goal

Use `vim` and `ts` and write tests using `jest`.
Try and complete each day but don't stress too much. 

### Day 1 - Trebuchet

Extracting numbers and number words. Initial set up and used jest

### Day 2 - Code Conundrum

Possible and impossible games.

### Day 3 - Gear Ratio

Matrix crawling which I haven't finished.

### Day 4 - Scratchcards

Winning scratch cards. Trying to be more code golf. I left out a test for empty values I'm not strong enough!s

### Day 5 - If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer

Not started yet.
