# Advent of Code 2023

How many days can I get through this year?

## Goal

Use `vim` and `ts` and write tests using `jest`.
Try and complete each day but don't stress too much.

## Usage

I'm running this using `ts-node` like so:

```
 npx ts-node src/day1/index.ts
```

To run the tests use:

```
npm run test test/day6.test.js
```

This runs `tsc` and then the jest test in the transpiled js file.

## Days

### Day 1 - Trebuchet

Extracting numbers and number words. Initial set up and used jest

### Day 2 - Code Conundrum

Possible and impossible games.

### Day 3 - Gear Ratio

Matrix crawling which I haven't finished.

### Day 4 - Scratchcards

Winning scratch cards. Trying to be more code golf. I left out a test for empty values I'm not strong enough!s

### Day 5 - If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer

Got the first star. Figured out iterators in TS. Gave up cause for the second part my loops got caught in a loop.

### Day 6 - Wait For It

I'm hopeful that I can catch up today. I'm pretty proud of how this one went. Very TDD.

### Day 7 - Camel Cards

Really close to getting it on the same day. figured out the sort function and cementing interfaces.
